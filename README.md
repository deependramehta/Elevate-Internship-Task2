Student Record Management System – Project Brief
This is a simple, command-line Java application designed to manage student records using a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach.

Key Features:
Student Class: Each student has an ID, name, and marks.

ArrayList Storage: All student objects are kept in an ArrayList for easy manipulation.

Menu-Driven Interface: Users interact with a text-based menu to choose among:

Add Student: Input a new student’s details.

View Students: Display all stored student records.

Update Student: Modify an existing student’s name and marks based on their ID.

Delete Student: Remove a student record using their ID.

Exit: Closes the program.

How It Works:
When the program starts, it displays menu options.

The user selects an option and enters required information (like ID, name, or marks).

The chosen operation is performed immediately on the in-memory student records.

The user can perform multiple operations in a single session.

Learning Outcome:
You practice object-oriented design, real-world data structure usage (ArrayList), basic Java syntax, and the implementation of a practical CRUD interface suitable for any beginner project
